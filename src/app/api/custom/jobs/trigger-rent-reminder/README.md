1. Fetch all active customers with their bookings
2. Check payment status for each customer
3. Create new payment records if needed
4. Send appropriate email notifications:
   - Gentle reminders for payments due
   - Late payment warnings for overdue payments
5. Process all customers in parallel for better performance
6. Handle errors gracefully without stopping the entire job
