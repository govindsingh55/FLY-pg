# Rent Reminder System - Security Guide

Security considerations and best practices for the rent reminder system.

## üîí **Security Features Implemented**

### **Authentication & Authorization**
- ‚úÖ API endpoint requires bearer token authentication
- ‚úÖ Environment variable validation
- ‚úÖ Secure token comparison (constant-time)
- ‚úÖ Admin-level access control
- ‚úÖ Invalid token attempt logging

### **Data Protection**
- ‚úÖ Sensitive data masked in logs (API tokens)
- ‚úÖ Environment variable isolation
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data in error responses
- ‚úÖ Secure database connection handling

### **Input Validation**
- ‚úÖ Request body validation
- ‚úÖ Header format validation
- ‚úÖ Parameter sanitization
- ‚úÖ Error handling for malformed requests

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Checklist**

### **Environment Security**
- [ ] `JOB_TRIGGER_API_TOKEN` is cryptographically secure (32+ bytes)
- [ ] API tokens are not committed to version control
- [ ] `.env` files are in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Production environment variables are properly secured
- [ ] Database connection uses authentication

### **API Security**
- [ ] API endpoint is not publicly exposed without authentication
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented (if needed)
- [ ] HTTPS is used in production
- [ ] API tokens are rotated regularly
- [ ] Access logs are monitored

### **Email Security**
- [ ] Email service (Resend) API key is secure
- [ ] Sender domain is verified and owned
- [ ] Email content doesn't contain sensitive data
- [ ] Bounce and complaint handling is configured

### **Deployment Security**
- [ ] Production environment is isolated
- [ ] File permissions are properly set
- [ ] Log files are secured and rotated
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures are in place

## üîê **Best Practices**

### **Token Management**
```bash
# Generate secure tokens
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# Rotate tokens regularly (recommended: every 90 days)
# Update both .env file and automation scripts
```

### **Environment Variables**
```env
# ‚úÖ Good: Secure, descriptive names
JOB_TRIGGER_API_TOKEN=abc123...
RESEND_API_KEY=re_abc123...

# ‚ùå Bad: Weak or exposed tokens
JOB_TRIGGER_API_TOKEN=test123
API_KEY=password
```

### **Access Control**
- Limit API access to necessary systems only
- Use different tokens for different environments
- Monitor API usage and failed attempts
- Implement IP whitelisting if possible

### **Logging Security**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good: Masked sensitive data
log.debug(`Using API token: ${API_TOKEN.substring(0, 8)}...`)

// ‚ùå Bad: Exposing sensitive data
log.debug(`Using API token: ${API_TOKEN}`)
```

## üö® **Security Incident Response**

### **If API Token is Compromised**
1. **Immediately** generate a new token
2. Update environment variables
3. Update automation scripts
4. Review access logs for unauthorized usage
5. Monitor for unusual activity

### **If Email Service is Compromised**
1. Revoke Resend API key
2. Generate new API key
3. Review sent email logs
4. Check for unauthorized email sends
5. Update environment variables

## üìä **Security Monitoring**

### **What to Monitor**
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Email bounce rates and complaints
- Job execution failures
- Database access patterns

### **Log Analysis**
```bash
# Check for authentication failures
grep "Invalid API token" logs/app.log

# Monitor job execution
grep "[TASK-" logs/app.log | tail -20

# Check email delivery
grep "Email sent successfully" logs/app.log
```

## üîß **Security Testing**

### **Authentication Tests**
```bash
# Test without token (should fail)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/custom/jobs/trigger-rent-reminder

# Test with invalid token (should fail)
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid" http://localhost:3000/api/custom/jobs/trigger-rent-reminder

# Test with valid token (should succeed)
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $JOB_TRIGGER_API_TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/api/custom/jobs/trigger-rent-reminder
```

### **Input Validation Tests**
```bash
# Test malformed requests
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $JOB_TRIGGER_API_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d 'invalid json' http://localhost:3000/api/custom/jobs/trigger-rent-reminder
```

## üìã **Compliance Considerations**

### **Data Privacy**
- Customer email addresses are processed securely
- Payment information handling complies with regulations
- Data retention policies are followed
- Customer consent for notifications is obtained

### **Email Compliance**
- CAN-SPAM Act compliance (US)
- GDPR compliance for EU customers
- Proper unsubscribe mechanisms
- Sender identification in emails

## üîÑ **Security Maintenance**

### **Regular Tasks**
- [ ] Rotate API tokens quarterly
- [ ] Review access logs monthly
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly
- [ ] Monitor security advisories
- [ ] Test disaster recovery procedures

### **Annual Review**
- [ ] Security audit of the entire system
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Access control review
- [ ] Compliance verification
- [ ] Documentation updates
