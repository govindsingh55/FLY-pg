# Payload Blank Template

This template comes configured with the bare minimum to get started on anything you need.

## Quick start

This template can be deployed directly from our Cloud hosting and it will setup MongoDB and cloud S3 object storage for media.

## Quick Start - local setup

To spin up this template locally, follow these steps:

### Clone

After you click the `Deploy` button above, you'll want to have standalone copy of this repo on your machine. If you've already cloned this repo, skip to [Development](#development).

### Development

1. First [clone the repo](#clone) if you have not done so already
2. `cd my-project && cp .env.example .env` to copy the example environment variables. You'll need to add the `MONGODB_URI` from your Cloud project to your `.env` if you want to use S3 storage and the MongoDB database that was created for you.

3. `pnpm install && pnpm dev` to install dependencies and start the dev server
4. open `http://localhost:3000` to open the app in your browser

That's it! Changes made in `./src` will be reflected in your app. Follow the on-screen instructions to login and create your first admin user. Then check out [Production](#production) once you're ready to build and serve your app, and [Deployment](#deployment) when you're ready to go live.

#### Docker (Optional)

If you prefer to use Docker for local development instead of a local MongoDB instance, the provided docker-compose.yml file can be used.

To do so, follow these steps:

- Modify the `MONGODB_URI` in your `.env` file to `mongodb://127.0.0.1/<dbname>`
- Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file's `MONGODB_URI` to match the above `<dbname>`
- Run `docker-compose up` to start the database, optionally pass `-d` to run in the background.

## How it works

The Payload config is tailored specifically to the needs of most websites. It is pre-configured in the following ways:

### Collections

See the [Collections](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/collections) docs for details on how to extend this functionality.

- #### Users (Authentication)

  Users are auth-enabled collections that have access to the admin panel.

  For additional help, see the official [Auth Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/auth) or the [Authentication](https://payloadcms.com/docs/authentication/overview#authentication-overview) docs.

- #### Media

  This is the uploads enabled collection. It features pre-configured sizes, focal point and manual resizing to help you manage your pictures.

### Docker

Alternatively, you can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to spin up this template locally. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Follow [steps 1 and 2 from above](#development), the docker-compose file will automatically use the `.env` file in your project root
1. Next run `docker-compose up`
1. Follow [steps 4 and 5 from above](#development) to login and create your first admin user

That's it! The Docker instance will help you get up and running quickly while also standardizing the development environment across your teams.

## Property booking feature plan

This section tracks the implementation plan for room booking and payments from the Property Details page.

- [x] Replace room list with selectable room UI on the property page (in `BookingCard.tsx`).
- [x] Enable the Book button only when a room is selected.
- [x] On Book, open Drawer/Sheet similar to Schedule a visit.
- [x] Prevent guests from booking; show a modal prompting Sign in / Sign up.
- [x] Booking form to capture minimal inputs (foodIncluded) and submit to API.
- [x] Create endpoint POST `/api/custom/booking` to create a booking.
- [x] Compute price server-side from the selected room; store `roomSnapshot`.
- [x] Seed payment handling: create a pending Payment tied to the booking with due date.
- [ ] Extend price rules (e.g., add food plan cost, discounts, taxes).
- [ ] Payment UI flow (choose method, pay now, handle callbacks) and success page.
- [ ] Wire PhonePe env vars and signature verification utilities.
- [ ] Implement PhonePe initiation, redirect/instrument handling, callback + webhook.
- [ ] Update Payment and Booking status transitions automatically.

## PhonePe Payment Gateway Integration

The application now uses the official PhonePe Node.js SDK for payment processing. To configure PhonePe integration, you need to set the following environment variables:

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# PhonePe SDK Configuration
PHONEPE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
PHONEPE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
PHONEPE_CLIENT_VERSION=1
PHONEPE_ENV=UAT  # or PRODUCTION for live environment

# Legacy variables (still used for merchant ID)
PHONEPE_MERCHANT_ID=your_merchant_id_here

# UAT Sandbox Testing (for development)
PHONEPE_BASE_URL=https://api-preprod.phonepe.com/apis/pgsandbox
```

### Getting PhonePe Credentials

1. **For UAT/Testing**: Contact PhonePe integration team to get your UAT credentials
2. **For Production**: Get your credentials from the PhonePe business dashboard

### Environment Configuration

- **UAT Environment**: Use `PHONEPE_ENV=UAT` for testing
- **Production Environment**: Use `PHONEPE_ENV=PRODUCTION` for live payments

### UAT Sandbox Testing Setup

For comprehensive testing, follow the [PhonePe UAT Sandbox Setup Guide](PHONEPE_UAT_SETUP.md) which includes:

1. **PhonePe Test App Installation**
2. **Template Configuration** for success/failure scenarios
3. **Test VPAs and Card Details**
4. **Step-by-step Testing Workflow**

### Quick Testing with VPAs

For immediate UPI testing, use these predefined VPAs:
- **Success**: `success@ybl` (redirects within 5 seconds)
- **Failure**: `failed@ybl` (redirects within 5 seconds)  
- **Pending**: `pending@ybl` (redirects within 60 seconds)

### SDK Features

The integration includes:
- Payment initiation using the official SDK
- Order status checking
- Callback signature verification
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Callback Configuration

**Important**: PhonePe callbacks (webhooks) are configured on the PhonePe merchant dashboard, not through the SDK. You need to:

1. **Contact PhonePe Integration Team** to set up your callback URL
2. **Provide your callback endpoint**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/custom/payments/phonepe/callback`
3. **Ensure the endpoint is accessible** from PhonePe servers

The SDK handles payment initiation and status checking, while callbacks are managed separately by PhonePe.

### Testing

For testing purposes, you can use PhonePe's UAT environment which provides test payment flows without actual money transactions.

### End-to-End Payment Flow âœ…

1. âœ… Create booking + pending payment via POST `/api/custom/booking`
2. âœ… Initiate PhonePe payment via POST `/api/custom/payments/phonepe/initiate`
3. âœ… Client redirects to PhonePe payment page
4. âœ… PhonePe callback/webhook via POST `/api/custom/payments/phonepe/callback`
5. âœ… Payment status check via GET `/api/custom/payments/phonepe/status`
6. âœ… Success page at `/payments/success`

### Testing Tools

- **PhonePe Test Panel**: Development testing interface
- **Admin Tools**: Payment status management in admin dashboard
- **Success Page**: Enhanced payment result display
- **Callback Verification**: Secure signature validation

### Documentation

- ðŸ“– [PhonePe Testing Guide](PHONEPE_TESTING.md) - Complete testing instructions
- ðŸ”— [PhonePe Documentation](https://developer.phonepe.com/payment-gateway) - Official API docs

- [ ] Booking lifecycle updates (confirm, cancel) and admin workflows.

Notes
- Guests can still schedule a visit, but must sign in or sign up to book.
- Payments are created as `pending` by the API to prepare for the actual payment flow hookup.
- When the real payment gateway is integrated, update the API to create payment intents/sessions and redirect the user accordingly.
